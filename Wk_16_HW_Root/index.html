   <h2>UI/UX Designer</h2>
    <p>
        My origin story goes all the way back to an aspiring pre-med with a penchant for understanding the dynamic of human cognitive processes and behavior.
        Fast-forward to the trials and tribulations one usually encounters on such a path and, like the prophetic dream that repeatedly reminds Santiago,
        the protagonist in Paulo Coelhoâ€™s <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)">The Alchemist</a>, to fulfill his Personal Legend (what an individual has always desired to accomplish),
        I learned to accept my need for creative expression in harmony with continuous discovery and principles; hence my journey in the field of UI/UX design.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a designer, I see the product adapting to the user and not the other way around. In order to deliver such products, it is important to understand
        the user at their core and what they want to accomplish with, of course, a dash of visually appealing and responsive artifacts to elevate the user experience.
    </p>

   <h3>A Little Trivia</h3>

   <li>I am passionate about etymology (the origin of a word and the historical development of its meaning). The written word can convey so many meanings depending upon
      context, and thus is important in the communication of design, among other things.
  </li>
  <li>I was regional director during my undergrad years for a nationally renowned health organization for Asian/Pacific-Americans and hosted a conference (which I also
      designed the website for) while hospitalized: <a href= "https://apamsareg7.wixsite.com/westcoastcon2015">westcoastcon2015</a>.
  </li>
  
  <li>I am the brand ambassador and model for a dear friend's up-and-coming fashionably sustainable accessory line, <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08268NWWB/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9S1kEb1S90NTQ">Le Pamplemousse</a>.
  </li>

</ul>
